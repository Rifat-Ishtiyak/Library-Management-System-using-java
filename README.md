# Library-Management-System

 we did this project so that we can implement our ideas that we learned in Object Oriented Programming course, through this project. We need to apply the knowledge of Java in a real-life based problems and systems where user can interact with a simple library management system.

<h2> <b>Problem Analysis :  </b> </h2> 
 Storing large amount of data is the main problem of this project. By solving this project, we can store as many information as we want like student information, teacher information, book information. We can also store borrowed or returned details in a file also we can do some basic calculations. This application can be useful for a librarian who is in charge of a library.

 <h2> <b>UI Design Analysis :  </b> </h2>
 Users can interact with this application by performing some simple task or input. This project is easy to access for any user, also the UI is quite understandable. This can be improved by adding Java FX or Java Swing into this project. Also we can use database management system for storing the information.

<h2><b>Logical Analysis :  </b></h2>
100% logic has been applied in this project. This project is all about decision making. We need to give input in every step in this project. As result we use here so many logical operators and expressions. We use exception handling to avoid some erroneous input. Also there are so many logical function in this project to prevent avoidable circumstances.

<h2><b>OOP Concept Analysis :  </b></h2>
There mainly four OOP principles & they are: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction. In this project, all of these four OOP principles are used very carefully.
At first we make the data types or variables, private or protected by following the rules of Encapsulation. Every class in this project is properly encapsulated. It provides us the control over the data.
<br>  

Then we inherit attributes and method from one class to another by using Inheritance.  

There is a parent class named Patron, inherit all its child class like teacher-class student-class through inheritance.

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. Both run-time & compile-time polymorphism have been used in this project very carefully. 

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. In this project we use four interface and one abstract class to fulfill the demand of abstraction.
Also we override all the abstract method for implementation.

<h2><b>Impact of this Project :  </b></h2>
This project reduce time and effort. Anyone can use this project for their specific purpose. This type of project will help the people who are in charge of a library. In the past, the librarian used to store all the data into a big notebook by writing all the information one by one which is so much time consuming. But with this application the user can easily give input into the system and can modify them, also can perform all the function and calculation more efficiently. It’ll save more time for both user and customers of the library.

<h2><b>Limitations and Possible Future Improvements :  </b></h2>
There are some limitations in storing amount of information. As we’ve used arrays to store all the data. The programmer has to define a max number of array size in the code. If there are more information to store into this program, it will not able to handle that and the more the information the slower the applications response will be, also in this project we can use Java FX or Java Swing to make the user interface more friendly.
